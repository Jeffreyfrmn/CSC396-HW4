Issues Encountered:

I don't have a great local machine for training... I had the second problem running but I just couldn't get it trained in time... i know that's the whole point but still wanted to address it here.

I also had lots of frustration using Cyverse on this one. I think it had to do with the size of the data files and the pytorch-gpu kernel constraints. 
It would not run on Cyverse. Problem 1 ran, and it took a respectable amount of time. However I kept coming back to kernel failures for problem 2.

Appologies for getting this in last second.

Respectfully,
Jeffrey Freeman
